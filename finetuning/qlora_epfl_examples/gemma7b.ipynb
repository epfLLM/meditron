    "In this notebook and tutorial, we will download & run Google's new [Gemma 7B-parameter model](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b). From the Hugging Face page: \n",
    "> Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",

    "If you would like a fine-tuning guide, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/y9428NwTh3) or message me on [X](https://x.com/harperscarroll) to let me know!"

    "To re-try after you tweak your parameters, open a Terminal ('Launcher' or '+' in the nav bar above -> Other -> Terminal) and run the command `nvidia-smi`. Then find the process ID `PID` under `Processes` and run the command `kill [PID]`. You will need to re-start your notebook from the beginning.
